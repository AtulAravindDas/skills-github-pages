# Hey I am AtulðŸ‘‹
Currently pursuing my M.S. in Data Science at Boston University. I build machine learning models that actually behave and visualizations that speak louder than words.

This site is a living portfolio where I flex:
- My favorite projects
- Skills that pay the bills
- Hands-on experience at companies & initiatives
